# MyofibrilQuant
A set of tools used to analyze myofibril formation and growth

To measure a sarcomere's length or myofibril width, use the macro "Myofibril_Width_Length_FIJI.ijm" in FIJI. 
This program will prompt you for next steps.
Then, process the resulting data in MatLab using the script "Myofibril_Width_Length_MatLab"
This data can also be processed manually in excel with just a few extra steps.

To measure image brightness use the macro "GrayscaleMacro_FIJI" in FIJI.
This program will prompt you for next steps.
Then, process the resulting data in MatLab using the script "MeanGrayscale_MatLab"
This data can also be processed manually in excel with just a few extra steps.
